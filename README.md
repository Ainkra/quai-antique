# quai-antique
Quai Antique is a Savoyard restaurant website built with the Symfony web framework and Tailwind CSS. The website was developed and hosted on Laragon. This website is my final exam for my school. If you have any opinion/advice or other to give me, contact me by email: loisdupasquier21@gmail.com 

# Technologies Used:
- Symfony 6.2.* (A PHP framework for building web applications.)
- TailwindCSS 3.2.4 (A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and customizable user interfaces.)
- Laragon: A local web development environment for Windows.

# Builded with:
- Encore Webpack
 
# Setting up the project on local
1. Download .zip repository.

2. (a) Install laragon, and NodeJS (if necessary).
- https://laragon.org/download/index.html
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download Longterm support version (LTS)

Verify NodeJS installation with `node -v`. PHP is installed by default by Laragon.
If you are not in PHP 8.1, follow this guide: https://medium.com/@oluwaseye/add-different-php-versions-to-your-laragon-installation-d2526db5c5f1

(b) When laragon is successfully installed, open your folder explorer. Go at this path:
`C:/laragon/www/`

Drag and drop the .zip file, unzip it inside the folder. After unzip, you can remove .zip.

3. Run composer install for obtain all the necessary dependencies for Symfony.

6. In my part, I configured laragon to simply have to write in url: http://quai-antique.local.
(Right click, preferences)
