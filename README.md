### quai-antique
Quai Antique is a Savoyard restaurant website built with the Symfony web framework and Tailwind CSS. The website was developed and hosted on Laragon. This website is my final exam for my school. If you have any opinion/advice or other to give me, contact me by email: loisdupasquier21@gmail.com 

# Technologies Used:
- Symfony 6.2.* (A PHP framework for building web applications.)
- TailwindCSS 3.2.4 (A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and customizable user interfaces.)
- Laragon: A local web development environment for Windows.

# Builded with:
- Encore
 
# Setting up the project
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run composer install to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run your laragon and run command `npm run watch` to start the built-in web server.
4. In my part, I configured laragon to simply have to write in url: http://quai-antique.local.
